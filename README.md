An analysis of NYC Citibike bike sharing data from 2019 using Tableau for a client wanting to start their own bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. Although Des Moines is a very different city than NYC, the client wanted to analyze the data from a successful bikesharing company for their buissiness pitch.

Below is a visual representation of the random customer verus subscriber and gender breakdown

From this chart we can see that more than 3/4 of the riders are subscribers, making up most of the revenue. Also CitiBike in NYC is predominatly male users.

Next we have a graph for the number of users for the time of day.

From this graph we can conclude from 2am to 5am would be the optimal time for bike repairs as it is the time of day with the least riders. We can also see that the peak times for bike usage also correlate with the normal "rush hour" traffic times for car users.

Next is a map of where users start their trips and pick up bikes. Using a heat map we are able to see the hot spots of where the most bikes are picked up for use.

From this map we can see that in the city is where most of the bikes are picked up. 

Next is a chart showing the time and day of the week for useage

From this chart we are see weekly usage patterns. The red areas showing when the most bikes are used. Again a differnet visulazation to see that the most used is around the normal work commute windows. 

The next chart shows the duration of trips based on gender.

From this we can conclude that majority of the riders are using the bikes for about 10 minutes. That males make up majoirty of the users again.

## Summary
In conlcusion bikesharing is very popular in the NYC center. This maybe because owning a car and finding parking in NYC is extremely difficult so many people opt to bike share and not have to worry about owning, storing, or getting their own bike stolen. Majority of the users are male and are using the bikes for about 10 minutes on avergae. That the most bikes are needed during the peak rush hour times, morning and evening commute to work. Additonal inquires could be analying more about the demographic of the bike share users, not just gender but age and home address. Also by analyzing where the starting and ending points specifically during the peak hours could give our clients more information on where they want to place their own bikeshare stations.
